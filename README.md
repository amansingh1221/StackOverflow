## About The Project

![Screen Shot](./client/src/assets/sample.jpg)

This Project is based on MERN Stack which is a web application that provides users a platform to ask, resolve and share their queries. Users can sign up and log in to their account, Ask questions and answer the queries of other users.

The project consists of two main parts: the front-end and the back-end. The front-end is built with ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The back-end is built with NodeJS, a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

The front-end is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. It uses ReactJS components to create reusable UI elements and provides a seamless user experience. The back-end is responsible for handling data storage, authentication, and communication between the client and the server. It uses NodeJS modules to implement server-side logic and provides RESTful APIs for communication with the client.

Some of the key features of the application include:

User authentication and authorization using JWT tokens
Posting user queries and their answers.
The project is designed to be scalable and modular, allowing for easy maintenance and future enhancements. It can be deployed on Vercel and can be integrated with  MongoDB database. 

Overall, This project provides a comprehensive solution for users to resolve their queries online within no time, while also providing modern technologies for a fast and seamless user experience.

## Built With

The whole project is based on MERN Stack.Here I use MongoDB, Expess, Reactjs and Nodejs as a major frameworks.
